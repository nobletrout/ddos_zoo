# ddos_zoo
A collection of pcaps and simple scripts to create ddos attacks.

# structure
The directory structure is organized thusly `/ddos_attack_type/protocol/`

within each directory will be a pcap, perhaps a matching PoC script, and a readme file describing each potential attack type.

# what it isn't
This isn't going to be another github full of fleshed out skiddie scripts. The intent is to provide an archive of potential sources of DDoS activity. The PCAP's are intended for analyis. If there is a supporting script, it's intent is only to recreate the contents of the PCAP.
